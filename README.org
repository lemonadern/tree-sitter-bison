Bison grammar for [[https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter][tree-sitter]]. Created from the official documentation and from examples.

It also supports embedded languages in grammar files (C, C++, D and Java).

* Known limitations
This parser requires a semicolon between different grammar rules. While not in official documentation (as far as I kwow), it seems to be possible in practice to omit these semicolons.

For instance, while theorically valid, this parser cannot parse this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
first_rule: token1 token1

second_rule: token3 token4
#+END_SRC

Attemps to support this caused ambiguity in the parser.
If you want to use this parser, you will need to add semicolons, like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC
first_rule: token1 token1
;

second_rule: token3 token4
;
#+END_SRC
